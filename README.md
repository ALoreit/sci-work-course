## Git/GitHub Exercise

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * [Register](https://github.com/join) for a GitHub account (if you not already have one)
    * [Install Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git) (NOT GitHub Desktop) on your computer
    * Set up Git to connect to GitHub:
        * [Using HTTPS](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-a-repository-using-https) (easier, but you have to enter your username and password every time you push changes)
        * [Using SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories#cloning-a-repository-using-ssh) (more complicated, but you only have to set it up once)
    * Configure Git to use your name and email address

2. **Task: Git and GitHub workflow (basic)**
    * Fork this repository
    * Clone your newly forked repository to your computer
    * (Create a new branch, optional)
    * Find an unaltered text file `data/birth-dates/`, i.e. one which still has some missing information (`????` instead of a year)
    * Look up the birth date on Wikipedia and replace the `????` with the correct year
    * Commit and push your changes to your fork:
        * `git add`
        * `git commit`
        * `git push`
    * Send us a pull request on GitHub (and check back in a couple of days to see if there has been any activities associated with it)
    * ðŸŽ‰ Done! You have gotten your first pull request accepted! ðŸŽ‰

See the exercise materials for more information. There is a more advanced but _optional_ exercise as well.
